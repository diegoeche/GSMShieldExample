# WIP: GSM Shield Example

This example connects uses an M2M simcard to connect to the internet.


# Materials:

1. An M2M simcard
2. Arduino GSM shield
3. Arduino UNO (no need for jumpers since the shield goes perfectly on top)

# Requirements:

Install the GSM library `GSM.h`

# Test:

The serial monitor should provide debugging info.
